        <h2 id="content-1" class="heading"> Why I liked programming </h2>
        
        <p>I love computer programming because I love challenges and I like to solve complex problems. I love computer programming because it's give me the power to create something out of nothing by just typing some code </p>
        
        <h2 id="content-2" class="heading"> What program languages i am learning?</h2>
        <p>I’m currently a freshman right now, and I've jumped into <em> C programming</em> as my first language and I taught myself <em>C/C++</em>.When I first got into <em> C</em>, I thought programming was just something like this; Hard to comprehend/understand at first, but when you get the hang of it, you get really good at it, like everything else.</p>
<p>However, I read a book on<em> C (which was….pretty terrible) </em> and didn't understand most of it.I didn't finish the book, because it was torturing me and I lost almost all love for computers and programming.</p>
<p>So I went on a hiatus for 2 months, but in the beginning of November, I started going through C again, this time utilizing the internet. Surprisingly, It was pretty fun, and I learned a lot about <em> C </em> and computers!</p>
<p id="importance"> I also got to a level where I made Atari Breakout and <em> Pong games </em> and programs for my parents’ company. However, I actually also started with <em> Python </em> while quitting the hiatus.</p>
